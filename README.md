# Deep Learning (summer project)

One of my professors asked me if I wanted to do 
some research summer project, and of course I said Â¡yes!.

So this repository shows what I will do on the summer it's
about deep learning something basic, but I can't wait for it.

## Setup

For `python` just type in the terminal

````console
poetry install
````

For `R` I'll be using renv,  I'm not sure want else to do.

For `julia` nothing is necessary (yet).

Indeed, maybe for any language nothing is necessary because I
wanted to implement the algorithms from scratch.

## Notes

I'll take some notes in the `PDFs` folder, something basic.

## Bibliography
The same `PDFs`.
